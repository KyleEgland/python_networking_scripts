# python_networking_scripts
Repository for miscellaneous python 3 networking scripts.

## Synopsis
Most (if not all) of the informaiton provided by this repository comes from the book _Python Network Programming Cookbook_ (Dr. M. O. Faruque Sarker, PACKT Publishing).  This code was made following the book.  While it may not be all inclusive (I.e. not all the code from all the chapters is here) it is to serve as a reference for me - use it if you wish but I make no promises regarding the contents working status.

## Issues getting started
Issues found with installing supervisor module on Python 3.  The following command works to get it installed:

```python -m pip install git+https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor.git```
